# Towers Of Hanoi

# Goal

My goal was to create a game called the Towers of Hanoi and implement a software that can automatically find the solution (or “win”) the game using recursive algorithms.

# Methodology

Towers of Hanoi is a game in which there are a number of disks of different sizes in a tower and the objective of the game is to move the discs to another tower without placing a bigger disk on a smaller disk. I used stacks and lists to implement the data structures that are required. After that, I used several recursive algorithms to create a machine that can automatically solve that game quickly and efficiently given any implementation of the game/whatever state the game is in.
